Create a modern, vibrant, and high-converting landing page for a social media content creation agency called "Personal Brand Launch". 

The design should be:
- Clean, fresh, and energetic with a professional yet approachable vibe
- Use #c4ff00 (bright lime/neon yellow-green) as the primary accent color for CTAs, highlights, and key elements
- Light background (white/off-white) with dark text for readability
- Bold, large typography for headlines
- Smooth animations and micro-interactions
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Modern SaaS aesthetic (think Stripe, Linear, Vercel style but more colorful and fun)

Include these sections with placeholder content:
1. **Hero section** - Large headline, subheading, prominent CTA button, hero image/visual on the right
2. **Social proof strip** - Logos or text showing client trust
3. **Testimonials section** - Cards showing client results with before/after stats and quotes
4. **Pain points section** - 3 columns highlighting customer problems
5. **Benefits/Solution section** - "Old Way vs New Way" comparison or feature grid
6. **How it works** - 4 numbered steps with icons
7. **More benefits section** - 6 benefit cards with icons and descriptions
8. **FAQ section** - Accordion-style expandable questions
9. **Pricing section** - 3 pricing tiers in cards, middle one highlighted as "Most Popular"
10. **Footer** - Links and social media icons

Make the CTAs stand out with the #c4ff00 color and include urgency text like "Limited spots available" above buttons.

The overall vibe should feel exciting and confident - like a high-growth startup that gets results. Use generous whitespace, subtle gradients, and modern card-based layouts.

# FAQ

If you are a business owner who wants to grow and sell on social media and is willing to invest in a growth system that works then book a call. If you are not willing to invest please do not.

## What is the point of building up your personal brand?
What do all these people and their businesses have in common?

- **Kylie Jenner** - Kylie Cosmetics - Youngest Person to Become a Billionaire
- **Rihanna** - Fenty Beauty - 2.8 Billion Dollar Valuation
- **Ryan Reynolds** - Mint Mobile - Sold for 1 Billion
- **Logan Paul** - Prime - 3.1 Billion Dollar Valuation
- **The Rock** - Teremana Tequila - 3.5 Billion Dollar Valuation

All these people built up their personal brands by acting, singing, TV, or social media. When they started businesses because they had such BIG personal brands their companies exploded. Their personal brand essentially was their marketing. 

Social media is the best way for your average person to do this without being an actor, singer, or athlete. A regular business owner can build themselves and their business on social media like never before. There is a huge opportunity here, if you don't take it your competitors will and will take all your customers with them.

## Why should my business be on social media?
- There are **4.26 billion** social media users
- **54%** of people use social media to research products
- **71%** of purchase decisions are made on social media

---

## How much time does it take?
We take on as much of the workload as we can. We will research, script, edit and upload for you. The only thing you have to do is film since it is your personal brand. 

Filming time varies person to person but for most people **4 hours a month**. But we do not guarantee a time because for everyone it is different.

---

## What kind of results can I expect?
Results vary from person to person. Factors like your niche, target audience, number of posts per month all influence how fast you will grow!

### Case Study 1: Career Strategist
- **Before:** 700 followers
- **After:** 450K followers
- **Timeframe:** 6 months
- Everyone who has a job can be her target audience

### Case Study 2: Social Media Marketing for Business Owners
- **Before:** 0 followers
- **After:** 100K followers
- **Timeframe:** 7 months

In both cases, we built strong personal brands, 10xed our business, and have loyal followers that consist of our target customers.

Compared to paid marketing options social media looks a lot less appealing. But the results you get are so much more worth it even if it takes longer to get them. I am glad it's hard because otherwise, everyone would do it.

Short form content are videos **60 seconds or less** in **9:16 format**. These are your Instagram Reels, Facebook Reels, TikToks, YouTube Shorts, etc.
