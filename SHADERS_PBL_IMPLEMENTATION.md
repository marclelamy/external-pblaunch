✅ Smooth animations with useReveal hook
✅ Custom cursor and grain overlay
✅ Magnetic button interactions
✅ Font styles and spacing
✅ Border styles and shadows
✅ Staggered animation patterns

## Sections Order

1. Hero Section
2. Social Proof Section
3. Testimonials Section
4. Pain Points Section
5. Benefits Section
6. How It Works Section
7. Features Grid Section
8. Pricing Section
9. FAQ Section
10. Footer Section

## How JSON Integration Works

Each section component uses `useEffect` to fetch JSON data on mount:

```typescript
const [data, setData] = useState<any[]>([])

useEffect(() => {
  fetch("/1-testimonials.json")
    .then(r => r.json())
    .then(data => setData(data.testimonials))
}, [])
```

**Benefits:**
- Update JSON files to change content without touching code
- Changes reflect across all pages using that JSON file
- Easy content management for non-developers
- No rebuild required for content updates (in development)

## Next Steps

1. Add actual images to social proof section (currently placeholder divs)
2. Add hero image/video on right side
3. Test carousel functionality with real images
4. Test responsive layouts on mobile
5. Add actual links to CTAs
6. Implement smooth scroll-to functionality
7. Consider adding loading states while JSON files fetch

## Bug Fixes Applied

- Fixed `howItWorks is not defined` error in how-it-works-section.tsx (line 77) - changed to use `steps` variable
- Fixed testimonial image path from `quote` to `quoteImg` to match JSON structure
