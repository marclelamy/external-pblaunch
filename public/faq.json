            "question": "2 - What is the point of building up your personal brand?",
            "answer": "What do all these people and their businesses have in common? Kylie Jenner (Kylie Cosmetics - Youngest Billionaire), Rihanna (Fenty Beauty - $2.8B), Ryan Reynolds (Mint Mobile - Sold for $1B), Logan Paul (Prime - $3.1B), The Rock (Teremana Tequila - $3.5B). All these people built up their personal brands by acting, singing, TV, or social media. When they started businesses because they had such BIG personal brands their companies exploded. Their personal brand essentially was their marketing. Social media is the best way for your average person to do this without being an actor, singer, or athlete."
